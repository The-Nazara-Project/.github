</div>

The Nazara Project is an open source software project dedicated to building an application that lets the user register, update and manage their devices on [NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox).

Nazara was born out of the need for automation when it comes to managing high amounts of machine turnover in server rooms, labs and datacenters.

It should provide an easy to use CLI interface to allow IT professionals, developers and server administrators to easily register new machines or update existing machines with new hardware.

This organization was set up to contain the Nazara Project itself alongside its various surrounding components which it may require.

</div>

The name "Nazara" is inspired by the true name of the Reaper "Sovereign" of the Mass Effect games.
According to the [wiki](https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Sovereign), "Nazara" originates in the old Turkish word for "the one who sees/observes", which fit perfectly with the software we are building. It too observes and takes note of the information your machines hold and provides this data to NetBox.
